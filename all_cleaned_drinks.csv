Swedish Royal,Cocktail,,,Sean McClure,"Vermouth: Vermouth, like wine goes bad if it has been open for a while. Also it's best to keep it in the refrigerator after it has been open to keep it fresh. Vermouth will last about 3-4 months. There are many producers of vermouth, all varying in style and flavor, so we would recommend trying a couple out and finding which you prefer. It's also fun to taste the difference. This goes for both dry (French) and sweet (Italian). Depending on the type you use, you might want to adjust the quantities used in your cocktail to your liking.

Apricot brandy: There are many brands out there. We like to use the Rothman & Winter. Unlike other fruit liqueurs that can be cloyingly sweet, the Rothman & Winter delivers a sweetness and bouquet expected when enjoying a fresh apricot.

This is a nice cocktail for vodka martini drinkers that want a little twist on their cocktail. It's essentially a perfect martini made with vodka and apricot brandy."

Nieux Carré,Cocktail,,,Sean McClure,"This cocktail is a spin on a classic cocktail called the ""Vieux Carré"" or ""Old Square"". The original cocktail was created by a bartender at The Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans. Though this drink may have been derived from a traditional vermouth cocktail created in the mid-1800s, many people who encounter the Vieux Carré today will equate it to a Manhattan variation, served on the rocks.

This new or ""Nieux"" version is a little nuttier and lighter in body. The nutty flavors of the sherry brandy really play off the savory earthy notes of the Karlsson's Gold Vodka. Enjoy this cocktail with some cheese or as an after dinner drink. It is perfect in front of a fireplace."
L.E.S. Is More,Cocktail,,,Sean McClure,"This is a perfect spring or summer cocktail. The Esprit de June is a product that offers a touch of floral complexity. The brightness of the lemon really works well with the floral notes of the Esprit de June.

The name is a play on words stating that less is more or (L.E.S. is more). The L.E.S. is an abbreviation for two things. First being Lower East Side as it is a NYC inspired cocktail. Second being Lemon, Esprit de June, and Seltzer. The three ingredients used in the cocktail to complement the Karlsson's Vodka."

Root Down,Cocktail,,,Sean McClure,"Root-Infused Karlsson's Gold Vodka:

Ingredients & Equipment
- 5 750 ml. Bottles Karlsson's Gold Vodka
- 5 oz. Sarsaparilla (Can be purchased at Kalustyan's)
- 5 oz. Sassafras (Can be purchased at Kalustyan's)
- 2.5 oz. White birch bark (Can be purchased at Kalustyan's)
- 2.5 oz. Licorice root (Can be purchased at Kalustyan's)
- 5 l. Barrel from Tuthilltown distillery
- Spice grinder
- Cheesecloth
- 10 qt. Non-reactive sealable container
- Fine mesh sieve

Instructions
Soak the barrel in water for 24 hours to swell the wood staves and to seal the barrel. (If you put liquid into a dry barrel it will leak.)
Rinse the sarsaparilla, sassafras, white birch bark and licorice root in cold water and lay out on parchment paper to dry. Once dry roughly grind the ingredients using a spice grinder and add them to a 10 qt. sealable non-reactive container. Pour the vodka into the container (reserve the bottles), cover and let infuse for 6 hours shaking every hour. Once fully infused strain out the roots and barks out using a fine mesh sieve and cheesecloth.
Using a funnel fill the barrel with the infusion and plug the barrel. Let infuse for 1-2 months tasting until desired oak flavor is achieved. Note: The barrel can be used several times but the aging time will take longer the more you use it. For example the second time you might need to age it for 2-3 months. Once desired oak age is achieved remove the infusion from the barrel and pour it back into the bottles There will be less then what you started with due to evaporation and soaking. Use as a base for cocktails. It makes an interesting old-fashioned."

Apple Shrub Spritz,Cocktail,,,Sean McClure,"*Spiced apple shrub (yield- 1 qt.):

Ingredients
- 6 Organic apples (any kind, but I prefer to use gala and honey-crisp)
- 1 c. Dark brown sugar
- 1 c. Demerara sugar (sugar in the raw)
- 10 Allspice berries
- 3 Cinnamon sticks
- 2 tsp. Ground nutmeg
- 2 tsp. Ground mace
- 2 oz. Fresh ginger
- 4 Cloves
- 2 c. Apple cider vinegar (I like to use good stuff that has been aged in barrel)

Instructions
Core and chop the apples into one inch pieces and muddle them with the sugar and the spices. This should be done in small batches. Muddle them until the apples start to release their juice.
Let this mixture sit for 24 hours. This lets the apples have time to release more of their juice into the sugar and spice mixture.
The next day add the vinegar and mix well. Pour the mix into a large mason jar and let brew for a week at room temp in a dark place.
Once the week is over stir the mixture well and strain through a fine mesh sieve. Warm the shrub up if you still have residual sugar in the mix.
Cover and store in the refrigerator. This product has a very long shelf life."
